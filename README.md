repository with the keycad files for a shield that fits on the FRDM-MCXA153 development board.

For easy use i added a template folder (the zipped folder), in order to use this folder you need to unzip it and put it in your kicad templates folder. The template folder can be found in: C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\KiCad\versionNumber\templates

not yet tested if it actually fits. (25/02/2025)
